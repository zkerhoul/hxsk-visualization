# 2Inspire - Biofeedback Application for Musical Performance 

This project extends the Hexoskin SDK demo application to create an application that provides real-time
respiratory biofeedback to a musical performer. Using the continuous thoracic and abdominal data streams
from a Hexoskin device, this application displays visualizations of a performer's respiration overlaid on
their musical score. 


## Requirements

After cloning the project, you can open it with Android Studio (recommended version is 4.1.2 or above) 
and run the app on an Android phone. Please note that this demo app requires bluetooth to work so it 
won't work on an emulator.
